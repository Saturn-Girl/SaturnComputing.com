		<h1>YandereUnityScript.exe Impact — How It Was Made</h1>
		<p>On October 11, 2025, the developer fired up their Windows 10 computer.</p>
		<p>They installed Unity 5.4, and after the installation finished, they launched it and created a new project.</p>
		<p>On October 12, the entire project was scrapped — but the idea lived on.</p>
		<p>On October 14 (two days before his birthday), the entire game was ported to Unity 2022.2.</p>
		<p>However, since Unity’s UI wasn’t working properly, he switched to Unity 2020.1.</p>
		<p>Since there was no text box feature, he hated it — so it turned into an FPS game, but the developer scrapped it again.</p>
		<p>The project was scrapped entirely. The Plus version will use Unity 5.4, while the original game will be rebuilt in MonoGame.</p>
		<p>The reason MonoGame was chosen is because the Windows 10 laptop couldn't start properly. So he used a linux machine with MonoGame</p>
		<p>In october 15 (1 day before the developer birthday) he switched to unity but he did not dare to do that</p>

		<h1>About the Developer</h1>
		<p>The developer is <span id="age"></span>-year-old programmer who knows 
			PHP, Dart, GML, Python, x86 Assembly, VBScript, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, 
			C, C++, C#, Ruby, Rust, R, and Lua — as well as Scratch and Adacraft. 
			Even though he’s still learning, he can already create his own games. 
			He also uses AI tools because he loves experimenting with artificial intelligence.
		</p>
		<p>He is silent and chill.</p>
		<p>He is currently in 7th grade, having graduated elementary school in April 2025.</p>
		<p>Even though he’s not yet an expert, he can already write solid basic code.</p>
		<p>He would even not listen to online classes to get more work done in projects.</p>
		<p>Even a boy or girl with basic engineering knowledge can beat this guy.</p>
