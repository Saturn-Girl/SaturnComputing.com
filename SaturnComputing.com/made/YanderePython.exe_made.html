      <p>This page contains the development logs, personal information, and history of <strong>YanderePython.exe</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>YanderePython.exe</strong> is a proprietary Yandere Simulator-inspired clone made in Ren’Py 7.5 using x86 assembly and some Python. It was developed by an 11-year-old coder who knows PHP, GML, Python, Assembly, VBScript, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, C/C++, C#, Ruby, Rust, R, Lua, Scratch, and Adacraft. He is a fan of old tech, GTA, Minecraft (portals!), RollerCoaster Tycoon, and also knows circuit wiring.</p>

    <section id="timeline">
      <h2>Development Timeline</h2>
      <p>The project began around October 31 or November 1, 2024, originally written in Python. While Python is slow, it's beginner-friendly—perfect for starting this project. Initially named <em>Yandere School Python Simulator</em>, it later became <strong>YanderePy</strong> in late November.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The game originally used OpenGL, which is a graphics library—not a full game engine.</p>
      <p>By late December 2024, the name changed to <strong>YanderePy.exe</strong> and the plan shifted to open source in Unity. The developer started prototyping in Unity 5.4 (without Unity Hub) using both C# and Python, unaware that Unity does not support Python natively. He learned C# from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@programmingwithmosh">Programming with Mosh</a> and from his previous project <strong>Lofi School Simulator</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> A planned romantic scene was removed in April–May 2025 as it did not fit the game’s direction.</p>
      <p>The Unity version only had a falling cube and no school environment. ChatGPT was asked for movement code, but it wasn’t used (<a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68c08ca1-8e04-8003-8381-65c6e55b8703">see chat for the OpenGL version</a>).</p>
      <p>The project later switched to <strong>Godot 3.2</strong> using GDScript.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="development">
      <h2>2025 Development</h2>
      <p>In January 2025, the project moved to <strong>Pygame + PyOpenGL</strong>. In March, the <a href="https://saturn-computing-topic.itch.io/yanderepyexe-pocket-edition-renpy-prototype">Ren'Py Pocket Edition Prototype</a> was created—an 18+ version with no boss fights.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> This Ren'Py version was the first proprietary game the developer ever made.</p>
      <p>In April, an April Fools’ build was made. Development slowed but resumed on May 17, with active progress by May 31.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Licensing</h2>
      <p>The project uses a proprietary license with a <code>License.txt</code> and <strong>EULA</strong>. Despite the Ren'Py version being the first working VN, the developer never wanted to make one in Unity.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Game Size</h2>
      <p>Originally aiming for 128 MB, the size target grew to 1.2 GB to allow compatibility with Windows 7. Windows 95–98 support was abandoned due to performance limits.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> YanderePy.exe is always 32-bit—x86 for 32-bit systems and x64-compatible for 64-bit ones.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tools">
      <h2>Art & Tools</h2>
      <p>Art was created in <strong>MS Paint</strong> and refined in <strong>GIMP</strong>. 3D models were made in Blender 2.80 (preferred for its light theme) and sometimes 3DS MAX.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="june">

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="july">
      <h2>July 2025</h2>
      <p>In July, the project switched to the <strong>Source Engine</strong>. On July 26, C++ code was converted to C so that x86 assembly could call it. On July 28, plans were made to embed QEMU to run KolibriOS inside the game. Later, the idea of using Raylib came up.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The ".exe" in the name is meant to teach Markiplier how .exe files work and give the project a creepypasta vibe.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the Source Engine was abandoned and the project moved to Raylib.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="UnityEngine">
      <h2>Unity Engine</h2>
      <p>On August 2, 2025, the developer switched to Unity 2022.2, mixing C# and assembly. No Python code was included in this version.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="renpy">
      <h2>Ren’Py Engine</h2>
      <p>On August 8, 2025, the developer switched to Ren’Py.</p>
      <p>In September 1 the codebase reached 596 lines of code and added a C# script called MonoBleedingEdge.cs.</p>
      <p>However, Chris (the developer) used AI to make it 594 lines of code.</p>
      <p>On September 5, the developer switched to Unity but quickly changed his mind and went back to Ren’Py.</p>
      <p>Mainly because he’s an idiot who doesn’t even have a proper mouse.</p>
      <p>On September 6, 2025, the developer scrapped the entire project.</p>
      <p>The game was originally supposed to release on September 10 at 3:50 PM, but now it’s September 11 at 3:50 PM (please don’t hate me 😅).</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The EGG part of the game represents the developer getting an EEG at September 10.</p>
      <p>In September 11 2025 the codebase reached 712 lines of code.</p>
      <p>At 6:45 PM YanderePython.exe was finally Released so PagerOS dev finally closed VS Code.</p>
      <p>But in September 12 he got back to working it and deleted the build on itch.io.</p>
      <p>In 10:08 PM of September 12 he compiled the game.</p>
      <p>In September 14 he went back from developing it and released it on September 26 2025.</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The scene where a character goes to another section in the game is based on the developer's real-life experience. In the game, the character Cassandra represents the developer, moving from Section A to Section B after getting into trouble. In real life, the developer, who is in Section Paul, had to move to Section Timothy for the same reason. (For safety reasons I won’t tell what I got in trouble for because that is violent.)</p>
      <p>For the code editor originally vs code but the developer uses sublime text</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact</strong> did you know that the character <a href="johnny.png">Johnny</a> is a modified version of jimmy neutron when the developer is imgining it he described it as jimmy neutron</p>
      <p>In September 17 the game is finally been released however episode 1 will be in september 26 and episode 2 will be in october 3 no episode 3 cause episode 2 is the last</p>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact</strong> Did you know some of the game like the character are taken from games yes using screenshot
      For example the chcracter yuki is just Yandere-Chan with long hair taken from Yandere Simulator build 2016
      For Lei it is taken from tomoka itoh from School Girls Simulator
      </p>
    
    </section>

    <p>In september 19 the development of YanderePython.exe Impact started</p>
    <p>
      In september 22 after the release of episode 1 the developer sleeped but when he woke up and decided 
      the he was gonna port the game into turbowarp as an RPG game. However the developer did not mind about it
      in september 23 the developer  switched to gdevelop. But again goes to renpy for episode 2 he called it quits and will work on it if he feels to
    </p>
    <P>In september 28 it got rebranded as YanderePython.exe Impact</P>
    <P>in october 12 the developer switched to unity 5 for the visual novel version of the game</P>

    <section id="UPBGE">
      <h2>Blender Game Engine/YanderePython.exe - 2</h2>
      <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>when the developer was working on the game he opened UPBGE and developed YanderePython.exe - 2 you might think it is open source nope it is also proprietary even with a GPL licensed engine</p>
      <P>But the developer said UPBGE sucks</P>

          <h1>About the Developer</h1>
		<p>The developer is <span id="age"></span>-year-old programmer who knows 
			PHP, Dart, GML, Python, x86 Assembly, VBScript, Fortran, Java, JavaScript, 
			C, C++, C#, Ruby, Rust, R, and Lua — as well as Scratch and Adacraft. 
			Even though he’s still learning, he can already create his own games. 
			He also uses AI tools because he loves experimenting with artificial intelligence.
      <p>He is silent and chill.</p>
		  He is currently in 7th grade, having graduated elementary school in April 2025.
		  Even though he’s not yet an expert, he can already write solid basic code.
		  He would even not listen to online classes to get more work done in projects
		  Even a boy or girl with basic engineering knowledge can beat this guy. cause this guy has a little knowlage of engineering
		</p>
      <P>He has autism. He uses 6502 assembly</P>
      <p><em>Ain’t no way he is a Project Sekai fanboy.If he is one he will drink rain water</em></p>
<p>
  He uses the Linux operating system, specifically <strong>Linux Mint</strong>.  
  While he had tried <strong>Ubuntu</strong>, it never worked properly on his PC.  
  On his laptop, Linux Mint was the only option he had.  
  When he installed Ubuntu, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/">GRUB</a> (the bootloader) was overwritten by Windows,  
  even when the SATA cable was disconnected.
