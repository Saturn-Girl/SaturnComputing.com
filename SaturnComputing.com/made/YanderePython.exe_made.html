    <section>
      <p>This page contains the development logs, personal history, and technical details of <strong>YanderePython.exe</strong>.</p>
      <p>A proprietary project originally made in Ren’Py 7.5 using x86 assembly and Python. Developed by a coder with a massive arsenal of languages including PHP, C++, Assembly, and Rust. A fan of old tech, GTA, and circuit wiring.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="timeline">
      <h2>Development Timeline</h2>
      <p>The project began around Halloween 2024. Originally named <em>Yandere School Python Simulator</em>, it was later renamed <strong>YanderePy</strong>.</p>
      <span class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The game originally used raw OpenGL before moving to full game engines.</span>
      <p>By late 2024, the plan shifted to Unity. Despite learning C# from Mosh, the early Unity versions only featured a falling cube. Eventually, the project switched to Godot 3.2 using GDScript.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="development">
      <h2>2025 Development & Engines</h2>
      <p>In early 2025, the project experimented with Pygame + PyOpenGL. March saw the release of the Ren'Py Pocket Edition Prototype—the first proprietary game from Saturn Computing.</p>
      <p><strong>Licensing:</strong> The project uses a proprietary license with a strict EULA. Windows 95–98 support was eventually abandoned in favor of Windows 7 compatibility (Target size: 1.2 GB).</p>
    </section>

    <section id="tools">
      <h2>Art & Tools</h2>
      <p>Visuals were crafted in <strong>MS Paint</strong> and <strong>GIMP</strong>. 3D work happened in <strong>Blender 2.80</strong> (Light Theme) and 3DS MAX. The project briefly moved to the <strong>Source Engine</strong> in July 2025 before being ported to Raylib for performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="renpy">
      <h2>Ren’Py & Release Cycle</h2>
      <p>September 2025 was chaotic. The developer switched between Unity and Ren’Py multiple times. The game was scrapped on September 6 but revived shortly after. <strong>YanderePython.exe</strong> finally released on September 17, with Episode 1 arriving September 26, 2025.</p>
      <span class="fun-fact"><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The character Yuki uses modified assets from the 2016 Yandere Simulator build.</span>
    </section>

    <section id="UPBGE">
      <h2>Blender Game Engine / YanderePython.exe - 2</h2>
      <p>While testing UPBGE, the developer started <strong>YanderePython.exe - 2</strong>. Despite using a GPL engine, this project remains proprietary.</p>

    <section id="GameMaker">
      <h2>YanderePython.exe Impact - 2 (GameMaker)</h2>
      <p>While we don't want to spoil too much, <strong>Impact - 2 runs on GameMaker</strong>. The game is set in 2028 with an older protagonist. It is planned to have a very sad ending set in the 2030s.</p>

      <h2>About the Developer</h2>
      <p>The developer is a <span id="age">12</span>-year-old programmer (7th Grade) who mastered elementary school in April 2025. He uses <strong>6502 and x86 Assembly</strong> and works primarily on Windows after various struggles with Linux GRUB bootloaders.</p>
      <p>He is silent, chill, has autism, and occasionally ignores online classes to finish his code. <em>"Ain’t no way he is a Project Sekai fanboy..."</em></p>
